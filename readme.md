# DIR #

#### Decentralised Investigative Report ####

A decentralized investigation report for people to report crimes to police in real time. As this Dapp is based on blockchain any malice can be easily seen and found.

The Dapp will have 4 consoles. One each for the user, police, investigators, and the judge. Once the user submits a DIR , it will be appended into the blockchain and can't be tampered with or removed after that.
